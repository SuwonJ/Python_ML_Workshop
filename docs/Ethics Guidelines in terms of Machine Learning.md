# Ethics Guidelines in terms of Machine Learning
Suwon Jang, Hyein Jo, Yewon Park

**Key words:** beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, explicability  


**Abstract:** As the discussion of the ethical dilemmas have come into real-life problems due to the advance of technologies, the decision of the dilemmas depends solely on engineers, but they shouldnâ€™t be the only one to make the decisions. There must be a guideline which protects the minimum rights for the people who can be involved with the decisions made by machine learning.

1. **Beneficence** should not be considered only for specific people, such as the customers of the car, or customers who made a submission to the research.  
2. Machine learning should observe **non-maleficence** in any aspects.  
3. When there was a decision made by Artificial Intelligence or a program run by machine learning, the mechanism and the point of view why the result was made should be indicated to the people who are involved, by providing **explicability**.  
4. Do not collect data illegally. And provide the source of the datas.   
5. The purpose of machine learning never includes malicious purposes.  
6. Data diversity must be secured by reviewing race, gender, age, social, and economic background factors from the data collection stage.
